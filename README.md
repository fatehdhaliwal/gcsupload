# gcsupload
Scripts to upload objects to Google Cloud Storage buckets

Created this because I often work on servers that don't come with gsutil installed and in cases where they're productionized, I may not always be able to install the needed tools myself.

The goal with this repo is to provide scripts in various languages to increase the likelihood of being able to run it in a language of your choice.

# Planned
Initial releases will cover C# and Python. I do plan on Powershell as well but welcome any contributions.
